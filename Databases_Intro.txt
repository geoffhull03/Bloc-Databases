1. Given the values table below, what data types do each of these values represent?

    Answer: A Clockwork Orange => String
            42 => Integer
            09/02/1945 => Integer
            98.7 => Float
            15.99 => Float
            payments => String

2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

    Answer: A database would be used for large sets of information that will need to be analyzed in the future.
    A database would be a good idea of scalability is a potential issue. If the data does not need to be extensively
    reviewed after use, a text file would be the smarter, more efficient decision.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

    Answer: The most obvious difference would be that SQL is a declarative language, where other programming languages
    are procedural. SQL looks to describe results and return those results from a database given the parameters.
    Procedural languages describe algorithms and they process steps of information.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

    Answer: Databases store all of the memory that an application can/needs to access. Information stored in objects, arrays,
    and other data types are all stored in a database so they can be accessed by a user (or users) at any point.
    Databases keep all information stored efficiently so that more complex applications can run faster and more
    efficient

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

    Table: A block of information in a database that stores and organizes columns, rows, and values
    Row: An individual line item that stores information. Usually, all cells in a row are related to one
      instance and is horizontal.
    Value: Each individual cell contains a value. It's some piece of information that the column name describes
    Column: A vertical label as to what type of information is stored. All column values are usually the same type of
    data.

6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.

    1. A String - Usually text (ex. "How Now Brown Cow")
    2. Integer - Any sort of number (non-decimal. ex: 14)
    3. Float - A decimal number (ex: 94.5)

7. Given the payments table below, provide an English description and the results for the following queries:

 SELECT date, amount
 FROM payments;
    The result will be the value(s) from the DATES and the AMOUNTS columns from the PAYMENTS table.

 SELECT amount
 FROM payments
 WHERE amount > 500;
    The result will be the amounts greater than 500 from the AMOUNT column in the PAYMENTS table.

 SELECT *
 FROM payments
 WHERE payee = "Mega Foods";
    The result will be all of the rows where the value in the PAYEE column is "Mega Foods" in the PAYMENTS table.

8. Given the users table below, write the following SQL queries and their results:

Select the email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.
    SELECT email, signup
    FROM users
    WHERE userid = 1;

Select the user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.
    SELECT userid
    FROM users
    WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'
Select all the columns for the user ID equal to 4.
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    WHERE userid = 4
