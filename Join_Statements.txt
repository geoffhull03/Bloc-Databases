1. How do you find data that is held in two separate data tables?
    Answer: You find that data by using a JOIN statement.

2. Explain, in your own words, the difference between a CROSS JOIN, INNER JOIN,
LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN. Give a real world example for each.
    CROSS JOIN: Produces every possible combination of each column from each table being queried.
    INNER JOIN: Combining tables that produces one row in the results table for each common row in the tables
    being queried.
    LO JOIN: Combines two tables where each row from the first table and each matching row from the second table are the results.
    RO JOIN: Results table contains each matching row between the queried tables as well as each row from the second table.
    FO JOIN: Combination of LO Join and RO Join -- Does inner join first. Fills in the null values in each table.

3. Define primary key and foreign key. Give a real world example for each.
    Answer: Primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table.
    Foreign key is a primary key of one table that is included as a non-unique attribute in another table.
    A primary key  in one table can be a foreign key in another table.

4. Define aliasing.
    Answer: The technique of creating short variable names, usually a single letter, to replace the table name in a query.

5. Change this query so that you are using aliasing:
  SELECT professor.name, compensation.salary, compensation.vacation_days
  FROM professor JOIN compensation ON professor.id = compensation.professor_id;

    Answer:

6. Why would you use a NATURAL JOIN? Give a real world example.
    Answer: A natural join would be perfect when you are combining tables that are associated by a foreign key.
